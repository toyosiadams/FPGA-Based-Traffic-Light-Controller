This line instantiates an instance of the Top module and connects its ports to the corresponding signals declared in the testbench (btl, btn2, rst, sub, rsult, clk, cathode, and seg7).
The clock signal and toggles it every 5 time units, creating a 100MHz clock.
Then it initializes the input signals, generates a VCD file for waveform dumping,
simulates button presses for input 1 and input 2, triggers a calculation (result = 1),
waits for a short time, and then resets the system. The simulation is set to run for 500 time units before finishing.
The testbench appears to cover different scenarios, including addition and subtraction, and checks if the calculator produces the expected results. The VCD file (waveform.vcd) can be viewed using a waveform viewer to analyze the simulation results.
