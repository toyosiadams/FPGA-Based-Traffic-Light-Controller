# FPGA-Based-Traffic-Light-Controller

The FPGA-Based Traffic Light Controller project focused on developing a traffic light control system using finite state machines (FSMs) on an FPGA. The design leveraged VHDL and Verilog for register transfer level (RTL) logic to ensure efficient and reliable operation. A custom clock synchronization circuit was created to control the precise timing of each traffic light phase—green, yellow, and red—ensuring smooth transitions between states. Python scripting was used to simulate and verify the system, with various test cases that validated the light sequences under different scenarios, confirming accurate functionality.
