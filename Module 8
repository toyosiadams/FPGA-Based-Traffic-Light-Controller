module CathodeClock(...): Declares a module named CathodeClock with input clk and outputs S (2 bits) and T
Initial begin: The block of code inside this initial block executes once at the beginning of simulation.
S = 2'b01; Initializes the 2-bit register S with the binary value 01.
T = S[0]; Initializes the register T with the value of the most significant bit of S
(bit at index 0).
The module is designed to create a simple 2-bit counter (S) that alternates between the binary values 01 and 10 on each rising edge of the clock (clk).
The current state of the counter is also reflected in the output T, which represents the most significant bit of S.
