Seg 7 Decoder is a 4-to-7 segment decoder module. It takes a 4-bit binary input bin and produces a 7-bit output seg7 to drive a 7-segment display.
The case statement checks the value of the 4-bit binary input bin.
Each case corresponds to a specific decimal digit (0 to 9). If the input matches a case, the corresponding 7-segment code is assigned to seg7
The default case is provided to handle any input value not covered by the specific case.
